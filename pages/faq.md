### General

#### What is Cryptotrader?

Cryptotrader is an algorithmic trading platform for cryptocurrencies that allows to automate your trading strategies via a flexible built-in scripting language based on [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/).

#### Is the installation of any software/plugins required?

We offer a comprehensive cloud-based solution, which requires no installation of any software. Bots run in our scalable VPS cloud 24/7.

#### Do I need coding skills to use your service?

  If you want to create your own strategies, a small amount of programming experience will be needed. Alternatively, our strategy market section provides a variety of free and paid strategies, many of which are developed by professional traders.

#### How do I deposit funds into my account here?

We do not hold your funds or have access to them. Trades are placed on your behalf on an exchange of your choice.

#### How can I make sure my funds are safe?

Bots connect to your exchange account through API keys that do not have permission to withdraw funds.

### Running bots
#### Is it a problem that two bots are running on the same exchange account?
It is not recommended to run two bots on the same account as they will compete for funds. Some exchanges (Poloniex, Bitstamp) allow you to create sub accounts and link them to your primary account.

### Strategy Market
#### What is strategy popularity?
  The strategy rating is a relative number representing the number of live instances that currently trade with this particular strategy for real money. For example, a strategy with a rating of 50% is being rented twice less often than a strategy with a rating of 100%.
  
#### Why do I have to pay for both for my subscription and the rental fee for the bot?
Primarily, Cryptotrader is an algorithmic trading platform that allows you to run your own trading strategies and we charge for cloud resources allocated for bots. The Strategy Market was built on top of the platform to allow experienced bot developers to make a profit by renting out their trading strategies.

#### When I rent a premium strategy, how many bot instances can I run on my account with this strategy?
With a rented strategy, you can run as many bot instances as your subscription allows.
